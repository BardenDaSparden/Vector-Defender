##Overview

Vector Defender is A 2-Dimensional, vector-stylized, shape shooter game written in Java. Vector Defender is
multi-platform and is capable of running on Windows, OSx, and most flavors of Linux. This game was originally
written as a proof-of-concept for myself. After some time, I've decided to re-open the project, and continue
development.
